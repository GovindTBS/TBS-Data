# Summary of Keys and Methods :
    
    $ RSA (2048-bit): Used for signing and signature verification.
        Certificates: Client Sign-In Certificate (for signing), Citi Sign-In Certificate (for verification).
    
    $ AES-256-GCM: Used for encrypting and decrypting data.
        Certificates: Client Encryption Certificate (for encryption), Citi Encryption Certificate (for decryption).
    
    $ TLS v1.2: Used for secure communication.
        Certificates: Client TLS Certificate, Citi TLS Certificate.

# Certificates Involved
